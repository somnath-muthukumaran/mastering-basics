- **Consistency Model** - ACID vs eventual consistency

### **Step 6: Detailed Design Deep Dive (8-12 minutes)**

- **Choose Critical Component** - Focus on most complex/important service
- **Internal Architecture** - Service decomposition, design patterns
- **Data Flow** - Request lifecycle, inter-service communication
- **Error Handling** - Retry logic, circuit breakers, fallbacks
- **Performance Optimization** - Caching, async processing

### **Step 7: Scale & Performance (5-8 minutes)**

- **Caching Strategy** - Multi-level caching, cache invalidation
- **Database Optimization** - Indexing, query optimization, connection pooling
- **Horizontal Scaling** - Stateless design, load distribution
- **Performance Monitoring** - Metrics, alerts, SLA tracking
- **Bottleneck Identification** - Single points of failure, performance hotspots

### **Step 8: Advanced Topics (3-5 minutes)**

- **Security Considerations** - Data encryption, secure communication
- **Monitoring & Logging** - Distributed tracing, centralized logging
- **Disaster Recovery** - Backup strategies, failover mechanisms
- **Data Pipeline** - ETL, analytics, real-time processing
- **Future Enhancements** - How to extend for new features
