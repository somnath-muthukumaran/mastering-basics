# LLD Interview Approach Checklist

## üéØ **Step-by-Step LLD Interview Approach**

### **Step 1: Requirements Clarification (3-5 minutes)**

- **Scope Definition** - What features to include/exclude in 45 minutes
- **User Types** - Different types of users and their capabilities
- **Core Functionality** - Primary use cases and workflows
- **Scale Expectations** - Concurrent users, data volume, performance needs
- **Technology Constraints** - Any specific languages, frameworks, or limitations

### **Step 2: Entity Identification (5-7 minutes)**

- **Extract Nouns** - Identify all business objects from requirements
- **Group Related Entities** - Cluster entities by domain/functionality
- **Define Entity Hierarchy** - Identify inheritance relationships
- **Validate Completeness** - Ensure all major business concepts are covered

### **Step 3: Relationship Mapping (5-8 minutes)**

- **Define Cardinality** - One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationships
- **Identify Dependencies** - Which entities depend on others
- **Map Entity Interactions** - How entities communicate and collaborate
- **Consider Lifecycle** - Creation, modification, deletion dependencies

### **Step 4: Class Design (15-20 minutes)**

- **Define Core Classes** - Main business entities with attributes and methods
- **Design Service Layer** - Business logic and operation classes
- **Create Interface Contracts** - Public APIs and method signatures
- **Apply Design Patterns** - Factory, Strategy, Observer where appropriate
- **Handle Edge Cases** - Validation, error scenarios, boundary conditions

### **Step 5: API Design (5-8 minutes)**

- **REST Endpoint Design** - HTTP methods, URL structure, status codes
- **Request/Response DTOs** - Data transfer object design
- **Error Response Format** - Consistent error handling structure
- **Authentication/Authorization** - Security requirements for each endpoint

### **Step 6: Database Schema (3-5 minutes)**

- **Table Structure** - Primary keys, foreign keys, constraints
- **Index Strategy** - Performance optimization for key queries
- **Data Types** - Appropriate column types and sizes
- **Relationship Implementation** - Junction tables for many-to-many

### **Step 7: Technical Considerations (2-3 minutes)**

- **Concurrency Handling** - Thread safety and race condition prevention
- **Caching Strategy** - What to cache and cache invalidation
- **Performance Optimization** - Query optimization, lazy loading
- **Security Measures** - Input validation, authentication, authorization

### **Step 8: Extension & Scale Discussion (2-3 minutes)**

- **Future Enhancements** - How design supports new features
- **Scalability Considerations** - How system handles growth
- **Alternative Approaches** - Trade-offs and different design choices
- **Deployment Considerations** - Microservices vs monolith implications

## üìã **Quick Reference Checklist**

### **‚úÖ Must-Have Components in Every LLD:**

- [ ] Clear entity definitions with attributes
- [ ] Service layer with business logic
- [ ] Data access layer (Repository/DAO pattern)
- [ ] API endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- [ ] Database schema with relationships
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] At least 2-3 design patterns applied
- [ ] Security considerations (authentication/authorization)

### **‚úÖ Bonus Points Components:**

- [ ] Caching strategy mentioned
- [ ] Concurrency handling discussed
- [ ] Monitoring and logging considerations
- [ ] Extension points for future features
- [ ] Performance optimization strategies
- [ ] Alternative design approaches discussed

### **‚ùå Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- [ ] Don't dive into HLD details (load balancers, microservices)
- [ ] Don't focus on implementation specifics (algorithms, data structures)
- [ ] Don't ignore error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Don't create god classes with too many responsibilities
- [ ] Don't forget to validate your design with example workflows
- [ ] Don't skip the database schema design
- [ ] Don't forget to explain your design pattern choices
